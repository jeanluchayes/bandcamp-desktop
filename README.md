# bandcamp Desktop
bandcamp Desktop is a desktop application written in C# by Giulio De Matteis.
It allows you to use bandcamp.com in an easy and quick way.

Note that bandcamp Desktop is not affiliated with Bandcamp, it is only a fan-made, free and Open-Source project.

## Features
- Simple as the website
- Header menu
- Mini Player

## Mini Player
Keep listening to the music while you explore the website! That's the killer feature of this web application.

It's very simple to use: just go to the album (or song, ep...) and click Music > Mini Player.

##Build Instructions
Make sure to enable "Release" and "x86" when building the solution, as it will nto work with "Any CPU".

#Install Instructions
After building the solution, in the installer-gen/Release folder, there will be an msi which you can use to install the bandcamp desktop app.
